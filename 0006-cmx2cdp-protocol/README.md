## Introduction

The CMX2CDP protocol is a [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC] protocol extension.

CMX2CDP is the protocol designed to communicate endpoint configurations from _configuration data provider_
implementations to the _configuration management extensions_.

## Requirements and constraints
### Problems and possible solutions

1. _Configuration push._

    Solutions:
    - CDP should broadcast event that new configuration is available.

2. _Configuration delivery confirmation after configuration push._

    Solutions:
    - CMX should broadcast event that particular endpoint has updated its configuration to specific version.
    >**NOTE:** In case of CMX configuration pull no delivery confirmation is required since endpoint can
    recognise delivery fail and request its configuration again.

3. _It is possible that there are two CDP instances configured to work with different
content types and one originator service instance. When originator service publishes config event
message with certain content type it is consumed by both CDPs._

    Solutions:
    - CDP should filter messages by their content types.

4. _If CMX asks for endpoint configuration but there is no configuration currently available,
CDP should somehow inform about it._

    Solutions:
    - Use HTTP status codes and arbitrary reason phrases.


#### Key concept

There are two messaging approaches used in CMX-CDP communication:
- [Configuration pull](#configuration-pull)
- [Configuration push](#configuration-push)

### Configuration pull

Is used when CMX is intended to request particular configuration.

#### Subject structure

CMX should send message using NATS to the next subject:

    kaa.v1.service.{cdp-service-instance-name}.cmx2cdp.{message-type}

Also, CMX should include NATS `replyTo` field which points to CMX replica that will handle the response:

    kaa.v1.replica.{cmx-service-instance-replica-id}.cmx2cdp.{message-type}

Refer to [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC] for explanation of above subject parts.

#### Targeted message types:

There are next types of such messages:
- _"config-request"_ message - is sent by CMX.
- _"config-response"_ message - is sent by CDP.

_"config-request"_ message structure:

- `correlationId` (string, required) - refer to [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC] documentation for description.
- `timestamp` (number, required) - timestamp of the message creation time.
- `timeout` (number, required) - the amount of time from timestamp that message is actual.
- `endpointMessageId` (string, required) - unique identifier of original endpoint message.
- `appVersionName` (string, required) - application version to which endpoint configuration is applicable.
- `endpointId` (string, required) - unique identifier of endpoint to which configuration is applicable.
- `configId` (string, optional) - unique identifier of endpoint configuration. If not present, response message will
hold configuration with latest version.

Example:

```json
{
  "correlationId": "07d78e95-2c4d-4899-957c-b9e5a3701fbb",
  "timestamp": 1490303342158,
  "timeout": 3000,
  "endpointMessageId": "6b73cd7c-1de5-4c4e-bbad-b7eda079ccbd",
  "appVersionName": "39774993-a426-4092-9e38-02ec213272d0",
  "endpointId": "b197e391-1d13-403b-83f5-87bdd44888cf",
  "configId": "76d34f8b-c038-413f-b122-318dce49edd1"
}
```

_"config-response"_ message structure:

- `correlationId` (string, required) - see [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC] for description.
- `timestamp` (number, required) - timestamp of the message creation time.
- `timeout` (number, required) - the amount of time from timestamp that message is actual.
- `endpointMessageId` (string, required) - unique identifier of original endpoint message.
- `appVersionName` (string, required) - application version to which endpoint configuration is applicable.
- `endpointId` (string, required) - endpoint unique identifier to which configuration is applicable.
- `contentType` (string, required) - content type of configuration, e.g.: json, protobuf.
- `configId` (string, required) - unique identifier of endpoint configuration.
- `statusCode` (number, required) - status code that holds meaningful information about the result of inbound message processing.
- `reasonPhrase` (string, required) - status code that holds meaningful information about the result of inbound message processing.
- `content` (byte[], optional) - content with configuration data.
- `isApplied` (boolean, required) - shows if client has latest configuration (true if he does).

Example:

```json
{
  "correlationId": "07d78e95-2c4d-4899-957c-b9e5a3701fbb",
  "timestamp": 1490303342158,
  "timeout": 3000,
  "endpointMessageId": "6b73cd7c-1de5-4c4e-bbad-b7eda079ccbd",
  "appVersionName": "39774993-a426-4092-9e38-02ec213272d0",
  "endpointId": "b197e391-1d13-403b-83f5-87bdd44888cf",
  "contentType": "json",
  "configId": "76d34f8b-c038-413f-b122-318dce49edd1",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "reasonPhrase": "OK",
  "content": {
    "bytes": "d2FpdXJoM2pmbmxzZGtjdjg3eTg3b3cz"
  },
  "isApplied": true
}
```

### Configuration push

Event-based approach as described in [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC] documentation can be used as alternative,
thus manipulations with endpoint configurations are accepted as events.

#### Subject structure

CMX and CDP should listen on and send broadcast messages to the next subject:

    kaa.v1.events.{originator-service-instance-name}.endpoint.config.{event-type}

For subject parts explanation refer to [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC].

There are next types of such messages:

* _"updated"_ message - is initiated by CMX when it receives notification that particular endpoint has updated
configuration.
* _"new-available"_ message - is initiated by CDP when it receives new configuration.

_"updated"_ message structure:

- `appVersionName` (string, required) - application version to which endpoint configuration is applicable.
- `endpointId` (string, required) - unique identifier of endpoint to which configuration is applicable.
- `configId` (string, required) - unique identifier of endpoint configuration.

Example:

```json
{
  "correlationId": "6fd9b270-2b74-428b-a86f-fee018b932f0",
  "eventTimestamp": 1490350896332,
  "originatorReplicaId": "1758dc39-63d2-47d0-9b58-6f617a4e0bba",
  "appVersionName": "39774993-a426-4092-9e38-02ec213272d0",
  "endpointId": "b197e391-1d13-403b-83f5-87bdd44888cf",
  "configId": "76d34f8b-c038-413f-b122-318dce49edd1"
}
```

_"new-available"_ message structure:

- `appVersionName` (string, required) - application version to which endpoint configuration is applicable.
- `endpointId` (string, required) - endpoint unique identifier to which configuration is applicable.
- `configId` (string, required) - unique identifier of endpoint configuration.

Example:

```json
{
  "correlationId": "0fce883f-1104-4da7-8a35-e790ecced6ac",
  "eventTimestamp": 1490351044418,
  "originatorReplicaId": "3b823589-d90b-497e-91f8-0209ecaef908",
  "appVersionName": "39774993-a426-4092-9e38-02ec213272d0",
  "endpointId": "b197e391-1d13-403b-83f5-87bdd44888cf",
  "configId": "76d34f8b-c038-413f-b122-318dce49edd1",
  "contentType": "json",
  "content": {
    "bytes": "d2FpdXJoM2pmbmxzZGtjdjg3eTg3b3cz"
  }
}
```

Regardless of specified above broadcast types all other restriction concerning message
fields are applicable from [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC] documentation.

## Use cases

### UC1

Once CDP service accepts new configuration, it publishes event message
with configuration content on NATS subject and all other services which have previously subscribed to
this subject receive the message. On the other side, CDP also listens to config-based
events and replies on them accordingly.

### UC2

Once endpoint was connected it can ask for its configuration initiating request to CMX which
forwards it to specific CDP.

## Glossary
